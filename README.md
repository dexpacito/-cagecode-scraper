scraping CAGE codes to populate a excel sheet

PERSONAL PROJECT
I wrote this code (with the help of AI) to speed up the process of data collection from the CAGECode archive. The code uses webscraping tools to query the website for a given set of CAGE codes, and returns 
data in a more friendly format for consumption.

honestly, preety low effort and probably low quality, but i just wanted to put it up here jic its ever needed.
